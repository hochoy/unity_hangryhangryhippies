# HangryHangryHippies

This game prototype was developed by:  
1. David Choy  
2. Weijun Chu  
3. Theresa Marie  
4. Graham Reid

**Idea**<br>
The inspiration for this game came from Hungry Hungry Hippos, a popular children's game that Theresa had played as a child. The original game had players as hippos trying to gobble up as many balls as possible from the center of the board. In our remake of the game, we play as a character in the center of the board who is surrounded by Hangry Hippie Hippoes. To survive and make it to the next level, the character has to feed the hippoes special explosive balls 10 times before they explode and die.

**Roles**<br>
Theresa shaped most of the idea for the game and started some basic platform and hippo shapes in Unity3D.
David took the basic platform and shapes and made them functional via Unity3D and C# coding. All interaction, GUI and AI are thus far coded by David.
Weijun created the central character model and will be adding more architecture to the Arena via Blender.
Graham has completed an awesome Hippo animation using Blender that has not yet been implemented.

**Status**<br>
[HangryHangryHippies_v1](https://hochoy.github.io/unity_hangryhangryhippies/index.html) is the link to the working game!
The project was completed as of 1st January 2017. More features and art were planned for this project but as each member has gone on to work on other game projects, we have chose to end it here. David will revisit this prototype when the time comes.
